# Network-IDS
This aims to build an AI-based Network IDS, a predictive model distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections. 
This will be a BINARY classification problem. 
Aims to compare the following models :
  Fully-Connected Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
