# Network-IDS
This aims to build an AI-based Network IDS, a predictive model distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections. 
This will be a BINARY classification problem. 
Aims to compare the following models :
  Fully-Connected Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Why did you build this?
In order to build an AI-predictive model that can detect attacking connections. This was one of my first implementations of FCNN and CNN models.

## What did you learn from this?
Since this was one of my earliest implementations of the FCNN and CNN models, I learned a lot about the structure of these models such as the layering, the data fitting, and frameworks such as NumPy. I also learned about label encoding and normalizing numeric features through this project.
